This project is a renovation of the old website of a fellow artistâ€™s sister. 
This will be a landing page, with no backend at the moment. 
The client is mainly involved in restoration. 
There are drawings, paintings and restored furniture on the website.
Responsiveness is a priority in the project. 
The theme of the website is a fabulous, colorful visual world at the request of the customer. 
This will be my first reference work that I would like to show in my future web development career.
